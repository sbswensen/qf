qf : quick forms

The method in use here is to mix it with complicated forms. This provides the
benefits of one installation ( reducing server maintenance works) and also using
one authentication system to log on to the system (comfort).


## Projects Used

* Golang
* MySQL
* Ubuntu


## Limitations

* Document Schemas can't be edited (doesn't seem necessary). A workaround would be to delete the document schema and
  create another one.
